This is a project I started during Spring Break 2023. The goal is to create a robust tiling system that allows for a user to input arrow keys to move a "character" around the tiles.
The project was originally going to be a maze but I have since decided that I will create seperate projects and alter this template for each use case. As of now, the user can move around the tiles and cannot move onto "borders" and will instead just collide with them.
